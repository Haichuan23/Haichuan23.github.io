Theory of Auction: [Notes](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1dm1p5jzci1h34bkld43a/Notes_on_Auction_Theory.pdf?rlkey=spljvqj08clflrv0md1n35iv6&st=syzobp8a&dl=0ï¼‰
This is my lecture note for ECMA30800: Auction Theory taught by Professor Philip Reny at UChicago (Winter, 2023). It covers the 4 standard auctions in independent private value model and interdependent value mode. It introduces concepts in mechanism design and discusses when the revenue for an auction is maximized. It also briefly discusses information aggregation in large market.
