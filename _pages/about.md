I am a rising second-year CS PhD student at Harvard University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Milind Tambe. My broad interest is studying how to integrate AI into society.

Previously, I studied at the University of Chicago, where I obtained a triple major in Computer Science (Honors), Economics (Honors), and Mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to work with Professor Haifeng Xu on game theory, and with Professor Anthony Zhang and Dr.Gordon Liao on Decentalized Finance.
