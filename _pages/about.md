I am an incoming CS PhD student at Harvard University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Milind Tambe. I am broadly interested in the intersection of Economics and Computer Science.

Previously, I studied at the University of Chicago, where I obtained a tripe major in Computer Science (Honors), Economics (Honors), and Mathematics. During my undegraduate years, I was fortunate to work with Professor Haifeng Xu on incentives in academia, and Professor Anthony Lee Zhang on a series of crypto projects. I have also interned at Circle, where I worked with Dr. Gordon Liao on DeFi related research.
