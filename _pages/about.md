I am a first-year CS PhD student at Harvard University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Milind Tambe. 

Previously, I studied at the University of Chicago, where I obtained a triple major in Computer Science (Honors), Economics (Honors), and Mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to work with Professor Haifeng Xu on incentives in academia and Professor Anthony Lee Zhang on a series of crypto projects. I have also worked as a research intern at Circle, where I worked with Dr. Gordon Liao on DeFi research projects.
